/**
 * <p>
 * This class is used to speed up the striping of lists, tables, trees and
 * comboboxes that use Radiance default renderers. This class is for internal
 * use only.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The usage is this:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Call {@link #setup(JComponent)} before starting painting the component
 * cells. An example -
 * {@link RadianceTableUI#paint(java.awt.Graphics, JComponent)} that should
 * call this method prior to the call to its <code>paintCells</code>.</li>
 * <li>The specific renderer should call
 * {@link #applyStripedBackground(JComponent, int, JComponent)}.</li>
 * <li>After all cells have been rendered, call {@link #tearDown(JComponent)}.
 * </ul>
