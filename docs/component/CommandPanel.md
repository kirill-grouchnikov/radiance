## Components - command panels

Command panel is a two-dimensional grid of logically and visually grouped commands (and their projections). In the screenshot above the commands are separated into multiple groups, each with its own title. In each group the projected buttons are laid out in rows, never exceeding the available container width and kicking vertical scrolling as necessary.

### Content model

`CommandPanelContentModel` is the content model for command panels. It is constructed from a list of `CommandGroup` objects which effectively serve as content models for each individual command group. As with [command strips](CommandStrip.md), commands can be added to and removed from these individual command groups. In addition, command groups can be added to and removed from the overall command panel model.

The `singleSelectionMode` attribute can be used to mark all commands configured as toggle to belong to a single toggle group model.

### Presentation model

`CommandPanelPresentationModel` and its `Builder` are the presentation model for command button panels.

The `layoutSpec` attribute can be used to specify whether the button content of each group should be laid out horizontally or vertically. In the screenshot below the same content model is projected into a column-based layout:

The `toShowGroupLabels` attribute is only relevant when `layoutSpec` is `PanelLayoutSpec.RowFill`. When set to `true`, button groups show titles:

The `commandPresentationState` attribute determines the visual presentation of the commands in the projected buttons. When the presentation state is set to `FIT_TO_ICON`, use `commandIconDimension` to control the icon size for the projected buttons.

### Projection

`CommandPanelProjection` is the projection that combines `CommandPanelContentModel` content model and `CommandPanelPresentationModel` presentation model. The result of `buildComponent` is a Swing component of the `JCommandButtonPanel` class.

### Sample code

First we create a few command groups that are then combined together into a single-selection command panel model:

```java
List<CommandGroup> commandGroups = new ArrayList<>();

MessageFormat mf = new MessageFormat(resourceBundle.getString("PanelStyles.text"));
mf.setLocale(locale);

for (int groupIndex = 0; groupIndex < 4; groupIndex++) {
    String commandGroupName = mf.format(new Object[] { groupIndex });
    List<Command> commands = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 0; i < 15; i++) {
        final String deco = groupIndex + "/" + i;
        RadianceIcon.Factory iconFactory = DecoratedRadianceIcon.factory(
                Font_x_generic.factory(),
                ...
                });
        Command command = Command.builder()
                .setIconFactory(iconFactory)
                .setToggle()
                .setAction(commandActionEvent ->
                        System.out.println("Invoked action on " + deco))
                .build();
        commands.add(command);
    }

    commandGroups.add(new CommandGroup(commandGroupName, commands));
}

CommandPanelContentModel commandPanelContentModel =
        new CommandPanelContentModel(commandGroups);
commandPanelContentModel.setSingleSelectionMode(true);
```

Then we create a presentation model in the default `PanelLayoutSpec.RowFill` mode, with all projected buttons using `FIT_TO_ICON` layout and icons sized at 48 pixels:

```java
CommandPanelPresentationModel commandPanelPresentationModel = CommandPanelPresentationModel.builder()
      .setToShowGroupLabels(false)
      .setCommandPresentationState(CommandButtonPresentationState.FIT_TO_ICON)
      .setCommandIconDimension(48)
      .build()
```

Now we combine the `CommandPanelContentModel` content model and the `CommandPanelPresentationModel` presentation model into a `CommandPanelProjection` and then call `buildComponent()` to get a Swing component that can be added to the component hierarchy of our application (here, wrapped in a `JScrollPane` container):

```java
CommandPanelProjection commandPanelProjection = new CommandPanelProjection(
    commandPanelContentModel, commandPanelPresentationModel);
contentPanel.add(new JScrollPane(commandPanelProjection.buildComponent());
```
