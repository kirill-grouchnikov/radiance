## Flamingo - advanced components for modern Swing applications

The goal of this project is to provide a robust set of additional Swing components that can be used as building blocks for creating modern, rich Swing applications. In addition to providing powerful command button and breadcrumb bar components, Flamingo packs an Office Command Bar (ribbon) container that can host a complex hierarchy of flexible, scalable application control surface.

Flamingo is built on top of [Laf](../laf/laf.md). All Flamingo components are rendered based on the currently set Radiance skin.
