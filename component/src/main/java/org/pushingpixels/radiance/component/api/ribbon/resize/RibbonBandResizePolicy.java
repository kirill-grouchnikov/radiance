/**
 * Defines the resize policies for the {@link JRibbonBand}s and
 * {@link JFlowRibbonBand}s.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The resize policy defines a single visual state of the given ribbon band. For
 * every control in the specific ribbon band (command button, gallery etc), the
 * resize policy defines what is its presentation state.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The resize policies are installed with
 * {@link AbstractRibbonBand#setResizePolicies(java.util.List)} API. The order
 * of the resize policies in this list is important. The first entry in the list
 * must be the most permissive policy that returns the largest value from its
 * {@link #getPreferredWidth(int, int)}. Each successive entry in the list must
 * return the value smaller than its predecessors.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As the ribbon horizontal size is changed (by the user resizing the
 * application window), the ribbon task resize sequencing policy set by
 * {@link RibbonTask#setResizeSequencingPolicy(RibbonBandResizeSequencingPolicy)}
 * determines the order of ribbon bands to shrink / expand. See more details in
 * the documentation of the {@link RibbonBandResizeSequencingPolicy}.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies} provides a number of built in resize
 * policies that respect the application element priorities passed to
 * {@link JRibbonBand#addRibbonCommand(CommandButtonProjection, JRibbonBand.PresentationPriority)}
 * and
 * {@link JRibbonBand#addRibbonGallery(RibbonGalleryProjection, JRibbonBand.PresentationPriority)}
 * APIs. There are three types of built in resize policies:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>Resize policies for the {@link JFlowRibbonBand}s. The {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies.FlowTwoRows}
 * and {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies.FlowThreeRows} allow placing the flow ribbon band content in two
 * and three rows respectively.</li>
 * <li>Resize policies for the {@link JRibbonBand}s. The
 * {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies.BaseCoreRibbonBandResizePolicy} is the base class for these policies.
 * These policies respect the {@link JRibbonBand.PresentationPriority} associated on
 * command buttons and ribbon galleries in {@link #getPreferredWidth(int, int)}
 * and {@link #install(int, int)}. While {@link #install(int, int)} call on a
 * {@link JFlowRibbonBand} only changes the bounds of the flow components, this
 * call on a {@link JRibbonBand} can also change the presentation state of the
 * command buttons (with
 * {@link JCommandButton#setPresentationState(CommandButtonPresentationState)} )}
 * ) and the number of visible buttons in the ribbon galleries.</li>
 * <li>The collapsed policy that replaces the entire content of the ribbon band
 * with a single popup button. This is done when there is not enough horizontal
 * space to show the content of the ribbon band under the most restrictive
 * resize policy. Activating the popup button will show the original content
 * under the most permissive resize policy in a popup. This policy is
 * implemented in the {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies.IconRibbonBandResizePolicy}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition to the specific resize policies, the
 * {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies} provides three core resize policies lists
 * for {@link JRibbonBand}s:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies#getCorePoliciesPermissive(JRibbonBand)}
 * returns a list that starts with a resize policy that shows all command
 * buttons in the {@link CommandButtonPresentationState#BIG} and ribbon galleries
 * with the largest number of visible buttons, fully utilizing the available
 * screen space.</li>
 * <li>{@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies#getCorePoliciesRestrictive(JRibbonBand)}
 * returns a list that starts with a resize policy that respects the associated
 * ribbon element priority set on the specific components.</li>
 * <li> {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies#getCorePoliciesNone(JRibbonBand)} returns
 * a list that only has a <code>mirror</code> resize policy that respects the
 * associated ribbon element priority set on the specific components.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note that as mentioned above, all the three lists above have the
 * <code>collapsed</code> policy as their last element.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In addition, the
 * {@link CoreRibbonResizePolicies#getCoreFlowPoliciesRestrictive(JFlowRibbonBand, int)}
 * returns a restrictive resize policy for {@link JFlowRibbonBand}s. The list
 * starts with the two-row policy, goes to the three-row policy and then finally
 * to the collapsed policy.
 * </p>
